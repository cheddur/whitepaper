# Introduction

Blockchain technology is currently modeling the same exponential growth that
the Internet did in the 1990s. The number of cryptocurrency projects (coins,
tokens, and
[DApps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/))
that were launched between 2014-17 tracks closely to the number of websites
that were launched on the Internet between 1991-95. The number of
funded
[Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/)
between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of Internet companies that
received venture capital funding between 1991-95. And most importantly,
the number of people who downloaded a wallet and bought their first
cryptocurrency between 2014-17 tracks closely to the number of people who
bought a modem and connected to the Internet for the first time between
1991-95[^fn1].

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/)---one of the industry's leading
wallet providers---has over 27M users as of August 2018[^fn2].
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), another industry giant, currently has
over 20M users[^fn3]. And [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), one of the
industry's leading exchanges, has acquired over 9M users within its first year
of operation[^fn4]. If we were to estimate that there are ~30M unique
cryptocurrency users worldwide (as of August 2018), we are currently in the
year 1996 when compared to the Internet. The Internet surpassed 1 billion users
just 9 years later (December, 2005), and based on the above similarities in
growth, it is reasonable to estimate that **~1 billion people will enter the
cryptocurrency market by the year 2027[^fn5]**.

## Barriers to Entry

In 2018, the barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency market is still very high.

* Cryptocurrency is a brand new asset class that most people do not have any
familiarity with. Many consumers have lots of questions, doubts, and
uncertainties about cryptocurrency, and it currently takes too much time,
energy, and experience to get answers.

* Most cryptocurrency tools and applications are extremely technical and,
to newcomers especially, it can feel like you need a Ph.D. in computer science
just to get started.

* The fiat-to-crypto "on-ramps"---platforms like
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), and
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)---are simplifying the purchasing process, but
are neglecting the educational components that are needed to help new users
understand *what* it is that they are buying so that they can make better
investment decisions.

* According to
[CoinSchedule](https://www.coinschedule.com), 25 new ICOs have launched every
single week between January and August of 2018[^fn6]. This is up over 500%
from the number of ICOs that were launched in 2017[^fn7]. Even though the
floodgates are just starting to open, keeping up is already a full-time job
for consumers.

* The developers of these cryptocurrency projects need to grow their
communities of users and investors in order to survive, and this is becoming
increasingly difficult (and expensive) as competition floods the market.

* There's almost no (helpful) regulation in the space and, as a result,
scammers are running rampant. A
[recent study](https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d28giW28tf6G7T_Wr77aU0gDgFQ)
from the [Statis Group](http://satisgroup.io/), an ICO advisory firm, suggests
that *more than 80%* of ICOs that were conducted in 2017 were scams[^fn8].

## Parallels to the Internet

The cryptocurrency industry in 2018 is still the Wild West and, similar to the
comparisons made above, this too is much like the Internet in 1996.
Cybercriminals---skilled, organized, and motivated by financial
gain---were at work sending spam email, orchestrating phishing attacks, defacing
websites, and stealing private information[^fn9]. New dot-com companies were
launching every single day, but were focusing their resources on "fast-tracking
to IPO, without adequate emphasis on a viable business plan, solid mission,
and inspiring vision"[^fn10]. Furthermore,
[very few investors understood the technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg),
let alone the companies they were investing in.

This was the recipe for the dot-com collapse of 2000, of which only 48% of
Internet companies survived and countless investors lost their
life savings[^fn11]. Today, we're seeing the same ingredients coalesce in the
cryptocurrency markets as uneducated investors are beginning to enter the
market, scammers are preying on newcomers through
[fake Twitter accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/6-outrageous-moments-crypto-twitter-scam-history/)
and
[cryptocurrency "giveaways"](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/money-nothing-cryptocurrency-giveaways-net-thousands-scammers-0),
hackers are
[stealing from exchanges and smart contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-hacks/),
and all the while
[ICO fever](https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-falling-revenue-ico-fever-remains-high/)
continues to grow.

## Taming the Wild West

So in order to get involved, what you need is a TRUSTED EXPERT in your life,
someone who can help guide you to safely enter the market, and then navigate
the market once youâ€™re in it.
