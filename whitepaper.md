# Introduction

Blockchain technology is currently modeling the same exponential growth that
the Internet did in the 1990s. The number of cryptocurrency projects (coins,
tokens, and
[√êApps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/))
that were launched between 2014-17 tracks closely to the number of websites
that were launched on the Internet between 1991-95. The number of
funded
[Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/)
between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of Internet companies that
received venture capital funding between 1991-95. And most importantly,
the number of people who downloaded a wallet and bought their first
cryptocurrency between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of people who
bought a modem and connected to the Internet for the first time between
1991-95[^fn1].

## Market Size

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/)---one of the industry's leading
wallet providers---has over 27M users as of August 2018[^fn2].
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), another industry giant, currently has
over 20M users[^fn3]. And [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), one of the
industry's leading exchanges, has acquired over 9M users within its first year
of operation[^fn4]. Estimating that there are ~30M unique cryptocurrency users
worldwide (as of August 2018), we are currently in the year 1996 when compared
to the Internet. The Internet surpassed 1 billion users just 9 years later
(December, 2005), and based on growth comparisons above, it is
reasonable to estimate that **~1 billion people will enter the cryptocurrency
market by the year 2027[^fn5]**.

## Barriers to Entry

In 2018, however, the barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency market is still
very high.

* Most consumers are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency as an asset class. As a
result, they have lots of questions, doubts, and uncertainties about
cryptocurrency, and it currently takes too much time, energy, and experience
to get answers.

* Most cryptocurrency tools, wallets, and applications are still extremely
technical and, to newcomers especially, it can feel as though you need a Ph.D.
in computer science just to get started.

* The fiat-to-crypto "on-ramps"---platforms like
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), and
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)---are greatly simplifying the purchasing
process, but have neglected the educational components that are needed to help
their users understand *what* it is that they are buying so that they can make
informed investment decisions.

* According to
[CoinSchedule](https://www.coinschedule.com), ~25 new ICOs have launched per
week between January and August of 2018[^fn6]. This is up over 500% from the
number of ICOs that were launched per week in 2017[^fn7]. Even though the
floodgates are just starting to open, keeping up is already a full-time job.

* There's very little (helpful) regulation in the space and, as a result,
scammers are running rampant. A
[recent study](https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d28giW28tf6G7T_Wr77aU0gDgFQ)
from the [Statis Group](http://satisgroup.io/) (an ICO advisory firm) suggests
that **more than 80% of ICOs that were conducted in 2017 were scams**[^fn8].

## Parallels to the Internet

The cryptocurrency industry in 2018 is still the Wild West and, similar to the
comparisons made above, this too is much like the early days of the Internet.
In 1996, cybercriminals---skilled, organized, and motivated by financial
gain---were busy sending spam email, orchestrating phishing attacks, defacing
websites, and stealing private information[^fn9]. New dot-com companies were
being launched every single day, but their resources were focused on
"fast-tracking to IPO, without adequate emphasis on a viable business plan,
solid mission, and inspiring vision"[^fn10]. Furthermore,
[few investors truly understood the technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg),
nor the companies they were investing in.

This was the recipe for the dot-com collapse of 2000, of which only 48% of
Internet companies survived and many investors lost their life savings[^fn11].
Today, we're seeing the same ingredients coalesce in the cryptocurrency market
as uneducated investors are beginning to enter the market, scammers are
preying on newcomers through
[fake Twitter accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/6-outrageous-moments-crypto-twitter-scam-history/)
and
[cryptocurrency "giveaways"](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/money-nothing-cryptocurrency-giveaways-net-thousands-scammers-0),
hackers are
[stealing from exchanges and smart contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-hacks/),
and
[ICO fever](https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-falling-revenue-ico-fever-remains-high/)
continues to grow.

## Problems

In order to get involved in the cryptocurrency market, most \uline{consumers}
need the help of a "trusted expert"---someone who can guide them to safely enter
the market and navigate the ecosystem. However, most consumers do not have a
trusted expert in their life, which puts cryptocurrency out of the reach of the
mainstream.

Furthermore, the \uline{developers} of cryptocurrency projects need to grow
their communities of users and investors in order to survive, and this is
becoming increasingly difficult (and expensive) as competition floods the
market.

# Cheddur 1.0

On October 30, 2017, the first version of [Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/)
was launched
[on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156)
and
[on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur)
to address these problems. Since then, Cheddur has served as the trusted
expert for over 50,000 consumers (as of August 2018) aiming to:

* Learn the basics of cryptocurrency.
* Find the best coins and ICOs to invest in.
* Find the best wallets, exchanges, and other crypto applications to safely
store, secure, and trade those coins.
* Read and write cryptocurrency reviews.
* Send and receive tips, payments, and donations in any cryptocurrency to other
users.
* Connect with friends, developers, and other cryptocurrency users.

In parallel, Cheddur has also served as an invaluable tool for over 2,000
cryptocurrency development teams (as of August 2018) seeking to:

* Share their mission and vision with the cryptocurrency community.
* Get discovered by---and connect with---new users and investors.
* Solicit (and respond to) user feedback in the form of ratings and reviews.
* Advertise their projects on the platform to increase their exposure.
* Grow their individual communities.

## Traction

Despite the bear market of 2018, our community of users and developers has been
growing steadily. As of August 2018:

* Over 50,000 consumers have been guided.
* Over 10,000 accounts have been registered.
* Over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews have been written.
* Over 2,000 coin addresses have been posted.
* Over 2,000 [coins](https://www.cheddur.com/coins) and
[crypto apps](https://www.cheddur.com/apps) have been listed.
* Over 200
[partnerships have been established](https://blog.cheddur.com/introducing-managed-coin-and-service-profiles-b33be38acf8d)
with cryptocurrency development teams across the globe.

We've also received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback over the past
few months, as evidenced by our
[\nicefrac{4.9}{5} rating on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156),
our
[\nicefrac{4.6}{5} rating on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur),
and our
[\nicefrac{4.5}{5} rating on Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/apps/cheddur).

# Cryptocurrency Reviews

We recognize that in 2018, a significant portion of the cryptocurrency projects
on the market may be of low quality, or may even be outright scams. While it is
important to identify these projects as such, deciding *which* projects are
scams and which projects are not is often a highly subjective process---at least
before any acts of crime have been committed.

## Using the Wisdom of the Crowd

As a company, we believe that it is best to neither be the judge nor jury over
these subjective decisions. When it comes to listing new coins and crypto apps
on Cheddur, our goal is to instead be *factually complete* and to list new and
interesting projects based on user demand and the facts that are available on
the Internet.

We believe that it is the responsibility of the cryptocurrency community as a
whole---rather than a central authority---to collectively determine the quality
of each project. This is commonly referred to as the "wisdom of the crowd"
principle[^fn12], and is currently being accomplished on Cheddur in the form of
user-generated cryptocurrency reviews.

## Challenges

In studying over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews on the Cheddur platform and
speaking with dozens of community members one-on-one, our team has been able to
identify several important challenges with user-generated reviews:

1. Tribalism is prevalent among cryptocurrency communities, and can cause users
to be overly positive in their reviews of coins that they hold (5 stars), or
overly negative in their reviews of "rival" projects (one star)[^fn13].
2. The developers of a cryptocurrency project are not permitted to remove user
reviews of their project, so long as those reviews abide by the
[Cheddur Content Guidelines](https://www.cheddur.com/about/guidelines). As a
result, developers may resort to astroturfing[^fn14] or vote brigading[^fn15] in
order to drown out critical reviews and/or fake their popularity on the
platform.
3. The less familiar a user is with cryptocurrency, the exponentially more
reliant they tend to be on the opinions (reviews) of others.
4. Generally speaking, the experts and innovators in the cryptocurrency
space---those with the wisdom and experience to produce the highest-quality,
most unbiased reviews---have not been properly incentivized in order for them to
spend the time and energy doing so.

## Conclusions

Maintaining the integrity of the Cheddur review system is critical towards
holding cryptocurrency projects accountable for their actions (or lack thereof)
and enabling consumers to easily distinguish between high-quality and
low-quality projects.

Based on the findings from the Cheddur user study above, we have been able to
make the following conclusions:

1. High-quality reviews ought to carry more weight towards determining a
cryptocurrency project's overall star rating then should spammy, low-quality
reviews.
2. If the quality of a review can be determined through the up-votes (or lack
thereof) that it receives, the *quality* of the users who casted the up-votes is
arguably more important than the *quantity* of users who casted votes.
3. In order to properly calculate the quality of each user, a reputation system
is needed. A user's reputation should dictate the amount of influence that user
has within the network.
4. Reputation cannot be an abundant resource that is freely available within the
network. Increasing a user's reputation must come at a cost to that
user---either financial, or in the form of sweat equity[^fn16].
5. To prevent timing attacks[^fn17], reputation within the network should not be
easily transferred or sold.
6. Rewards are needed to encourage users to acquire (and compete for)
reputation and influence in the network via the creation and curation of
high-quality content. By the same token, penalties are needed to discourage
users of influence from abusing it.

## The High Quality Review

In a recent study conducted by [Bizrate Insights](https://bizrateinsights.com/),
66% of US internet users reference online reviews before making a purchase, even
if they are not purchasing that item online[^fn18]. With 1 billion consumers
slated to enter the cryptocurrency market over the next 9 years, the
high-quality cryptocurrency review will be the backbone of mainstream consumer
decision-making around cryptocurrencies.

# Cheddur 2.0

To align the interests of review writers, review readers, cryptocurrency
development teams, and Cheddur, CHDR tokens will be introduced in
version 2.0 of the platform. The purpose of this token system is to:

* Establish a reputation system to delegate user influence in the network.
* Determine the subjective quality of each user-generated review using the
wisdom of the crowd.
* Incentivize users to create and curate the highest-quality cryptocurrency
reviews via financial rewards and network influence.
* More accurately calculate the overall star rating (and popularity) of each
cryptocurrency project by favoring reviews that are deemed to be high quality.
* Minimize the effects of tribalism, astroturfing, review brigading, and other
forms of malicious activity.
* Empower the Cheddur community to be self-policing and self-sustaining.
* Enable newcomers to the cryptocurrency ecosystem to *earn* their way into the
market with little or no downside risk.

## CHDR Tokens

In order to achieve this, the CHDR currency will utilize industry-leading
Proof of Brain[^fn19] properties pioneered by the [Steem](https://steem.io/)
blockchain and made available through the
[Smart Media Tokens](https://smt.steem.io/) (SMT) protocol.

# FAQ

0. Scam projects?
  * Not our decision. Our goal is to be factually complete. We focus on listing
  new and interesting cryptocurrency projects based on user demand and the
  *facts* that we find on the Internet. It is up to the Cheddur community to
  decide.
0. Sybil attack?
    * Even if restrictions are enacted at the account level to prevent a user
    from reviewing the same project more than once, these restrictions can generally
    be overcome through Sybil attacks.
1. How to prevent malicious voting?
    * Your votes have minimum weight by default
    * Voting power is based on the balance of vested coins in your account
        * More vested coins = more power, and visa versa
    * If you have high voting power (high stake) and you vote maliciously, you are hurting
    yourself because your coins are staked and you can't immediately sell them
    * This method of assigning power has been battle-tested on Steem
2. How will introducing the Cheddur currency grow the system?
    * Higher rate of inflation in the early days to incentivize early adoption
    * More users -> more competition -> review quality increases over time -> price goes up
        * More traffic -> more advertising -> more coins are burned -> price goes up
3. How to control inflation?
    * Burn advertising coins
4. How to prevent the price from dumping from users immediately selling rewards?
    * Selling will exist, but will incentivize users to vest portion of their earnings
        * Interest and voting power given to those who vest

# TODO

* market size: talk about VC investment, number of projects in 2020...
* Flush out scope of work:
    * Should profile submissions and edits be tokenized, too?
    * Can listings be tokenized later, or does this have to be set on day 1?
* Platform to build on?
    * Steem (SMT)
    * Steem (direct)
    * EOS
    * Ethereum
* ICO or Airdrop?
    * Use of funds
* Flush out all parameters of the monetary policy
    * Initial supply, distribution
    * Inflation curve
    * Rewards pool, distribution
    * Vesting / de-vesting
    * Platform fee vs. burning coins from the ad network:
        * No platform fee, but keep coins spent on advertising?
        * Platform fee, but burn all ad coins?
        * Platform fee, but burn ad coins up to a certain extent (e.g. BNB Coin)?
* Migration strategy
* Roadmap dates and features
