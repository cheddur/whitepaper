# Introduction

Blockchain technology is currently modeling the same exponential growth that
the Internet did in the 1990s. The number of cryptocurrency projects (coins,
tokens, and
[√êApps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/))
that were launched between 2014-17 tracks closely to the number of websites
that were launched on the Internet between 1991-95. The number of
funded
[Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/)
between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of Internet companies that
received venture capital funding between 1991-95. And most importantly,
the number of people who downloaded a wallet and bought their first
cryptocurrency between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of people who
bought a modem and connected to the Internet for the first time between
1991-95[^fn1].

## Market Size

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/)---one of the industry's leading
wallet providers---has over 27M users as of August 2018[^fn2].
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), another industry giant, currently has
over 20M users[^fn3]. And [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), one of the
industry's leading exchanges, has acquired over 9M users within its first year
of operation[^fn4]. Estimating that there are ~30M unique cryptocurrency users
worldwide (as of August 2018), we are currently in the year 1996 when compared
to the Internet. The Internet surpassed 1 billion users just 9 years later
(December, 2005), and based on growth comparisons above, it is
reasonable to estimate that **~1 billion people will enter the cryptocurrency
market by the year 2027[^fn5]**.

## Barriers to Entry

In 2018, however, the barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency market is still
very high.

* Most consumers are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency as an asset class. As a
result, they have lots of questions, doubts, and uncertainties about
cryptocurrency, and it currently takes too much time, energy, and experience
to get answers.

* Most cryptocurrency tools, wallets, and applications are still extremely
technical and, to newcomers especially, it can feel as though you need a Ph.D.
in computer science just to get started.

* The fiat-to-crypto "on-ramps"---platforms like
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), and
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)---are simplifying the purchasing process, but
have neglected the educational components that are needed to help their users
understand *what* it is that they are buying so that they can make informed
investment decisions.

* According to
[CoinSchedule](https://www.coinschedule.com), ~25 new ICOs have launched every
single week between January and August of 2018[^fn6]. This is up over 500%
from the number of ICOs that were launched in 2017[^fn7]. Even though the
floodgates are just starting to open, keeping up is already a full-time job.

* There's very little (helpful) regulation in the space and, as a result,
scammers are running rampant. A
[recent study](https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d28giW28tf6G7T_Wr77aU0gDgFQ)
from the [Statis Group](http://satisgroup.io/), an ICO advisory firm, suggests
that **more than 80% of ICOs that were conducted in 2017 were scams**[^fn8].

## Parallels to the Internet

The cryptocurrency industry in 2018 is still the Wild West and, similar to the
comparisons made above, this too is much like the early days of the Internet.
In 1996, cybercriminals---skilled, organized, and motivated by financial
gain---were busy sending spam email, orchestrating phishing attacks, defacing
websites, and stealing private information[^fn9]. New dot-com companies were
being launched every single day, but their resources were focused on
"fast-tracking to IPO, without adequate emphasis on a viable business plan,
solid mission, and inspiring vision"[^fn10]. Furthermore,
[few investors truly understood the technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg),
nor the companies they were investing in.

This was the recipe for the dot-com collapse of 2000, of which only 48% of
Internet companies survived and many investors lost their life savings[^fn11].
Today, we're seeing the same ingredients coalesce in the cryptocurrency industry
as uneducated investors are beginning to enter the market, scammers are
preying on newcomers through
[fake Twitter accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/6-outrageous-moments-crypto-twitter-scam-history/)
and
[cryptocurrency "giveaways"](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/money-nothing-cryptocurrency-giveaways-net-thousands-scammers-0),
hackers are
[stealing from exchanges and smart contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-hacks/),
and
[ICO fever](https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-falling-revenue-ico-fever-remains-high/)
continues to grow.

## Problems

In order to get involved in the cryptocurrency market, most \uline{consumers}
need the help of a "trusted expert"---someone who can guide them to safely enter
the market and navigate the ecosystem. However, most consumers do not have a
trusted expert in their life, which puts cryptocurrency out of the reach of the
mainstream.

Furthermore, the \uline{developers} of cryptocurrency projects need to grow
their communities of users and investors in order to survive, and this is
becoming increasingly difficult (and expensive) as competition floods the
market.

# Cheddur 1.0

On October 30, 2017, the first version of [Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/)
was launched as a free download
[on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156)
and
[on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur)
to address these problems. Since then, Cheddur has served as the trusted
expert for over 50,000 consumers (as of August 2018) aiming to:

* Learn the basics of cryptocurrency.
* Find the best coins and ICOs to invest in.
* Find the best wallets, exchanges, and other crypto applications to safely
store, secure, and trade those coins.
* Read and write cryptocurrency reviews.
* Send and receive tips, payments, and donations in any cryptocurrency to other
users.
* Connect with friends, developers, and other cryptocurrency users.

In parallel, Cheddur has also served as an invaluable tool for over 2,000
cryptocurrency development teams (as of August 2018) seeking to:

* Share their mission and vision with the cryptocurrency community.
* Get discovered by---and connect with---new users and investors.
* Solicit (and respond to) user feedback in the form of ratings and reviews.
* Advertise their projects on the platform to increase their exposure.
* Grow their individual communities.

## Traction

Despite the bear market of 2018, our community of users and developers has been
growing steadily. As of August 2018:

* Over 50,000 consumers have been guided.
* Over 10,000 accounts have been registered.
* Over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews have been written.
* Over 2,000 coin addresses have been posted.
* Over 2,000 [coins](https://www.cheddur.com/coins) and
[crypto apps](https://www.cheddur.com/apps) have been listed.
* Over 200
[partnerships have been established](https://blog.cheddur.com/introducing-managed-coin-and-service-profiles-b33be38acf8d)
with cryptocurrency development teams across the globe.

We've received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback over the past few
months, as evidenced by our 4.9/5 rating
[on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156),
our 4.6/5 rating
[on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur),
and our 4.5/5 rating
[on Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/apps/cheddur).

## Cryptocurrency Ratings & Reviews

We recognize that in 2018, a significant portion of the cryptocurrency projects
on the market may be of low quality, or may even be outright scams. While it is
important to identify these projects as such, deciding *which* projects are
scams and which projects are not is often a highly subjective process---at least
before any acts of crime have been committed.

Therefore, as a platform, we've chosen to neither be the judge nor jury over
this decision, and to instead focus on *facts*. When it comes to listing
coins and crypto apps on Cheddur, our goal is to be factually complete and to
list new and interesting projects based on user demand and the facts that are
available on the Internet.

Thus, in order to help newcomers steer clear of bad projects, we believe that it
is the responsibility of the cryptocurrency community---rather than a central
authority---to collectively determine the quality of each project. This is
accomplished on Cheddur in the form of user ratings and reviews.

## Challenges

Having amassed over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews on the platform (as of August
2018), we've identified a number of challenges with the current review system:

1. Tribalism is prevalent among cryptocurrency communities, and can cause users
to be overly positive in their reviews of coins that they hold (5 stars), or
overly negative in their reviews of "rival" projects (one star)[^fn12].
2. The developers of a cryptocurrency project are not permitted to remove user
reviews of their project, so long as those reviews abide by the
[Cheddur Content Guidelines](https://www.cheddur.com/about/guidelines). As a
result, developers may resort to astroturfing[^fn13] or vote brigading[^fn14] in
order to drown out critical reviews and/or fake their popularity on the
platform.
3. **Determining the quality of each review is paramount**, as high-quality
reviews should carry more weight towards a cryptocurrency project's overall
rating then spammy, low-quality reviews.
4. The experts and innovators in the cryptocurrency space---those with the
wisdom and knowledge to produce the highest-quality, most unbiased reviews---are
not being properly incentivized to spend the time and energy to do so.

## The Importance of Reviews

Why honest, unbiased reviews are so important.

* 2/3rds of US internet users reference online reviews before making a purchase
(even if they don't purchase that item online).
    * https://retail.emarketer.com/article/surprise-most-consumers-look-reviews-before-purchase/5a94768debd4000744ae413e
    * We believe this behavior is especially true for cryptocurrencies because
    most people don't fully understand the tech themselves and need to rely on
    the opinion of someone else.

# Cheddur 2.0

To properly incentivize the HQR, to help consumers discover the best projects,
and to hold projects accountable.


* System where users are rewarded for virtuous behavior on the
platform. Users are incentivized to:
    * Reviews:
        * Write and curate (upvote) high-quality reviews
        * Downvote low-quality reviews or malicious activity (bribed reviews?)
    * Listings (?):
        * List new coins and apps
        * Submit edits to existing coin and app listings
        * Claim profiles
        * Maintain profiles over time
* Empowers the community to self-police and self-sustain.
* Truly the "Yelp for crypto"
* How?
    * How do you maintain the integrity of the system?
    * How do you properly incentivize the innovators and experts in the space---those with the knowledge---to write reviews?
        * Especially when they are currently incentivized to NOT share (this is a financial edge in the market)

## Incentivizing High Quality Reviews

1. Quality is a subjective metric. If the quality of a review can be
determined through the up-votes (or lack thereof) it receives, the *quality* of
the users who casted the up-votes is arguably more important than the *quantity*
of users who casted votes.
2. In order to properly calculate the quality of each user, a reputation system
is needed. A user's reputation should dictate the amount of influence that user
has within the network.
3. Reputation cannot be an abundant resource that is freely available within the
network. An increase in a user's reputation must come at a cost to that
user---either financial, or in the form of sweat equity. Reputation within the
network should not easily be transferred or sold.
4. Rewards are needed to encourage users to acquire reputation and influence in
the network through the creation and curating high-quality content. By the same
token, penalties are needed to discourage users of influence from abusing it.

## Cheddur Currency

* Launching our own cryptocurrency, called Cheddur:
    * $CHDR (…Ñ)
    * Earn CHDR on Cheddur

* Why / benefits:
    * Incentivize production of high-quality information to inform your decision making
    * Earn your way into the cryptocurrency market without ever having to pull out your wallet
    * Positive feedback loop between reviewers and readers

### Initial Supply

* Total starting supply: 100M coins
    * Public distribution: 75M coins (75%)
    * Company reserve: 25M (25%)

### Inflation

* Predictable emission rate:
    * 9.5% in Y1
    * Decreases by 0.5% per year until we reach a minimum annual inflation of 1%
* Distribution:
    * 15% holders of Cheddur power
    * 15% company (platform fee)
    * 70% rewards pool

### Rewards Pool

* Every week (?), rewards are distributed to those who produce and curate the most valuable content
* Distribution:
    * 70% author?
    * 30% curation?
        * Does this change by the minute like Steem?

### Vesting / Staking

* Tokens can be "vested":
    * Gain influence (voting power) on the platform
    * Get annual interest
    * Prevents users from selling rewards directly into the market (helps the price)

### De-vesting / Un-staking

* Coins are de-vested over a 13-week period
    * Given out in 1-week increments
    * Can be canceled at any time

### Determining Overall Rating

### Advertising

* As competition over the rewards pool grows, traffic will grow with it
* Developers of these coins and apps will be able to advertise on the platform
    * Only allowed to pay with Cheddur, or 50% discount?
    * All coins earned through advertising will be destroyed (?)
        * Increasing the portfolio value of everyone who participates in the system long-term, i.e. through HODLing / vesting.
        * Helps fight excess inflation, good for price

### Use of Funds

* How we intend to use:
    * Our 25M initial keep
    * Platform fee earnings over time

## Competition

* Compare versus:
    * Revain
    * Review.Network
    * Utrum
    * ICOBox's "expert reviews"
* Metrics
    * Beginner friendly
    * Incentivized
    * Who pays?
    * Platform
    * How much raised in ICO
    * Filtration (auto vs crowd)

## Migration

* How will we migrate from v1 to v2?
    * User accounts
    * Existing reviews
    * User addresses
    * Possible removal from App Store
* Changes
  * Take down addresses?
  * Team members cannot upvote reviews of their projects (biased)

# Roadmap

Since the initial release of Cheddur in 2017, we've made continual progress:

* Q12018 - Managed Profiles (March)
* Q22018 - Took on first investor; began Startup Acclerator (Desai)
* Q32018 - Release of Website, tokenization progress, in discussion with investors (June...)

* Version 2.0:
    * ICO / Airdrop dates
    * Launch date
* Future features:
    * News
    * Chat
    * Q&A
    * Portfolio
    * Price Alerts
    * Tailored recommendations based on preferences, interests, risk tolerance

# FAQ

0. Scam projects?
  * Not our decision. Our goal is to be factually complete. We focus on listing
  new and interesting cryptocurrency projects based on user demand and the
  *facts* that we find on the Internet. It is up to the Cheddur community to
  decide.
0. Sybil attack?
    * Even if restrictions are enacted at the account level to prevent a user
    from reviewing the same project more than once, these restrictions can generally
    be overcome through Sybil attacks.
1. How to prevent malicious voting?
    * Your votes have minimum weight by default
    * Voting power is based on the balance of vested coins in your account
        * More vested coins = more power, and visa versa
    * If you have high voting power (high stake) and you vote maliciously, you are hurting
    yourself because your coins are staked and you can't immediately sell them
    * This method of assigning power has been battle-tested on Steem
2. How will introducing the Cheddur currency grow the system?
    * Higher rate of inflation in the early days to incentivize early adoption
    * More users -> more competition -> review quality increases over time -> price goes up
        * More traffic -> more advertising -> more coins are burned -> price goes up
3. How to control inflation?
    * Burn advertising coins
4. How to prevent the price from dumping from users immediately selling rewards?
    * Selling will exist, but will incentivize users to vest portion of their earnings
        * Interest and voting power given to those who vest

# Conclusion

Conclusion here.

# TODO

* Flush out scope of work:
    * Should profile submissions and edits be tokenized, too?
    * Can listings be tokenized later, or does this have to be set on day 1?
* Platform to build on?
    * Steem (SMT)
    * Steem (direct)
    * EOS
    * Ethereum
* ICO or Airdrop?
    * Use of funds
* Flush out all parameters of the monetary policy
    * Initial supply, distribution
    * Inflation curve
    * Rewards pool, distribution
    * Vesting / de-vesting
    * Platform fee vs. burning coins from the ad network:
        * No platform fee, but keep coins spent on advertising?
        * Platform fee, but burn all ad coins?
        * Platform fee, but burn ad coins up to a certain extent (e.g. BNB Coin)?
* Migration strategy
* Roadmap dates and features
