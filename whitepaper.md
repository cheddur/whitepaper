# Introduction

Blockchain technology is currently modeling the same exponential growth that
the Internet did in the 1990s. The number of cryptocurrency projects (coins,
tokens, and
[√êApps](https://www.coindesk.com/information/what-is-a-decentralized-application-dapp/))
that were launched between 2014-17 tracks closely to the number of websites
that were launched on the Internet between 1991-95. The number of
funded
[Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)](https://www.investopedia.com/news/what-ico/)
between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of Internet companies that
received venture capital funding between 1991-95. And most importantly,
the number of people who downloaded a wallet and bought their first
cryptocurrency between 2014-17 also tracks closely to the number of people who
bought a modem and connected to the Internet for the first time between
1991-95[^fn1].

## Market Size

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/)---one of the industry's leading
wallet providers---has over 27M users as of August 2018[^fn2].
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), another industry giant, currently has
over 20M users[^fn3]. And [Binance](https://www.binance.com/), one of the
industry's leading exchanges, has acquired over 9M users within its first year
of operation[^fn4]. Estimating that there are ~30M unique cryptocurrency users
worldwide (as of August 2018), we are currently in the year 1996 when compared
to the Internet. The Internet surpassed 1 billion users just 9 years later
(December, 2005), and based on growth comparisons above, it is
reasonable to estimate that **~1 billion people will enter the cryptocurrency
market by the year 2027[^fn5]**.

## Barriers to Entry

In 2018, however, the barrier to entry into the cryptocurrency market is still
very high.

* Most consumers are unfamiliar with cryptocurrency as an asset class. As a
result, they have lots of questions, doubts, and uncertainties about
cryptocurrency, and it currently takes too much time, energy, and experience
to get answers.

* Most cryptocurrency tools, wallets, and applications are still extremely
technical and, to newcomers especially, it can feel as though you need a Ph.D.
in computer science just to get started.

* The fiat-to-crypto "on-ramps"---platforms like
[Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.com/), and
[Bittrex](https://bittrex.com/)---are greatly simplifying the purchasing
process, but have neglected the educational components that are needed to help
their users understand *what* it is that they are buying so that they can make
informed investment decisions.

* According to
[CoinSchedule](https://www.coinschedule.com), ~25 new ICOs have launched per
week between January and August of 2018[^fn6]. This is up over 500% from the
number of ICOs that were launched per week in 2017[^fn7]. Even though the
floodgates are just starting to open, keeping up is already a full-time job.

* There's very little (helpful) regulation in the space and, as a result,
scammers are running rampant. A
[recent study](https://research.bloomberg.com/pub/res/d28giW28tf6G7T_Wr77aU0gDgFQ)
from the [Statis Group](http://satisgroup.io/) (an ICO advisory firm) suggests
that **more than 80% of ICOs that were conducted in 2017 were scams**[^fn8].

## Parallels to the Internet

The cryptocurrency industry in 2018 is still the Wild West and, similar to the
comparisons made above, this too is much like the early days of the Internet.
In 1996, cybercriminals---skilled, organized, and motivated by financial
gain---were busy sending spam email, orchestrating phishing attacks, defacing
websites, and stealing private information[^fn9]. New dot-com companies were
being launched every single day, but their resources were focused on
"fast-tracking to IPO, without adequate emphasis on a viable business plan,
solid mission, and inspiring vision"[^fn10]. Furthermore,
[few investors truly understood the technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlJku_CSyNg),
nor the companies they were investing in.

This was the recipe for the dot-com collapse of 2000, of which only 48% of
Internet companies survived and many investors lost their life savings[^fn11].
Today, we're seeing the same ingredients coalesce in the cryptocurrency market
as uneducated investors are beginning to enter the market, scammers are
preying on newcomers through
[fake Twitter accounts](https://www.coindesk.com/6-outrageous-moments-crypto-twitter-scam-history/)
and
[cryptocurrency "giveaways"](https://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/money-nothing-cryptocurrency-giveaways-net-thousands-scammers-0),
hackers are
[stealing from exchanges and smart contracts](https://blockgeeks.com/guides/cryptocurrency-hacks/),
and
[ICO fever](https://news.bitcoin.com/despite-falling-revenue-ico-fever-remains-high/)
continues to grow.

## Problems

In order to get involved in the cryptocurrency market, most \uline{consumers}
need the help of a "trusted expert"---someone who can guide them to safely enter
the market and navigate the ecosystem. However, most consumers do not have a
trusted expert in their life, which puts cryptocurrency out of the reach of the
mainstream.

Furthermore, the \uline{developers} of cryptocurrency projects need to grow
their communities of users and investors in order to survive, and this is
becoming increasingly difficult (and expensive) as competition floods the
market.

# Cheddur 1.0

On October 30, 2017, the first version of [Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/)
was launched
[on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156)
and
[on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur)
to address these problems. Since then, Cheddur has served as the trusted
expert for over 50,000 consumers (as of August 2018) aiming to:

* Learn the basics of cryptocurrency.
* Find the best coins and ICOs to invest in.
* Find the best wallets, exchanges, and other crypto applications to safely
store, secure, and trade those coins.
* Read and write cryptocurrency reviews.
* Send and receive tips, payments, and donations in any cryptocurrency to other
users.
* Connect with friends, developers, and other cryptocurrency users.

In parallel, Cheddur has also served as an invaluable tool for over 2,000
cryptocurrency development teams (as of August 2018) seeking to:

* Share their mission and vision with the cryptocurrency community.
* Get discovered by---and connect with---new users and investors.
* Solicit (and respond to) user feedback in the form of ratings and reviews.
* Advertise their projects on the platform to increase their exposure.
* Grow their individual communities.

## Traction

Despite the bear market of 2018, our community of users and developers has been
growing steadily. As of August 2018:

* Over 50,000 consumers have been guided.
* Over 10,000 accounts have been registered.
* Over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews have been written.
* Over 2,000 coin addresses have been posted.
* Over 2,000 [coins](https://www.cheddur.com/coins) and
[crypto apps](https://www.cheddur.com/apps) have been listed.
* Over 200
[partnerships have been established](https://blog.cheddur.com/introducing-managed-coin-and-service-profiles-b33be38acf8d)
with cryptocurrency development teams across the globe.

We've also received an overwhelming amount of positive feedback over the past
few months, as evidenced by our
[\nicefrac{4.9}{5} rating on the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1269377156),
our
[\nicefrac{4.6}{5} rating on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cheddur),
and our
[\nicefrac{4.5}{5} rating on Cheddur](https://www.cheddur.com/apps/cheddur).

# Cryptocurrency Reviews

We recognize that in 2018, a significant portion of the cryptocurrency projects
on the market may be of low quality, or may even be outright scams. While it is
important to identify these projects as such, deciding *which* projects are
scams and which projects are not is often a highly subjective process---at least
before any acts of crime have been committed.

## Using the Wisdom of the Crowd

As a company, we believe that it is best to neither be the judge nor jury over
these subjective decisions. When it comes to listing new coins and crypto apps
on Cheddur, our goal is to instead be *factually complete* and to list new and
interesting projects based on user demand and the facts that are available on
the Internet.

We believe that it is the responsibility of the cryptocurrency community as a
whole---rather than a central authority---to collectively determine the quality
of each project. This is commonly referred to as the "wisdom of the crowd"
principle[^fn12], and is currently being accomplished on Cheddur in the form of
user-generated cryptocurrency reviews.

## Challenges

In studying over 2,500 cryptocurrency reviews on the Cheddur platform and
speaking with dozens of community members one-on-one, our team has been able to
identify several important challenges with user-generated reviews:

1. Tribalism is prevalent among cryptocurrency communities, and can cause users
to be overly positive in their reviews of coins that they hold (5 stars), or
overly negative in their reviews of "rival" projects (one star)[^fn13].
2. The developers of a cryptocurrency project are not permitted to remove user
reviews of their project, so long as those reviews abide by the
[Cheddur Content Guidelines](https://www.cheddur.com/about/guidelines). As a
result, developers may resort to astroturfing[^fn14] or vote brigading[^fn15] in
order to drown out critical reviews and/or fake their popularity on the
platform.
3. The less familiar a user is with cryptocurrency, the exponentially more
reliant they tend to be on the opinions (reviews) of others.
4. Generally speaking, the experts and innovators in the cryptocurrency
space---those with the wisdom and experience to produce the highest-quality,
most unbiased reviews---have not been properly incentivized in order for them to
spend the time and energy doing so.

## Conclusions

Maintaining the integrity of the Cheddur review system is critical towards
holding cryptocurrency projects accountable for their actions (or lack thereof)
and enabling consumers to easily distinguish between high-quality and
low-quality projects.

Based on the findings from the Cheddur user study above, we have been able to
make the following conclusions:

1. High-quality reviews ought to carry more weight towards determining a
cryptocurrency project's overall star rating then should spammy, low-quality
reviews.
2. If the quality of a review can be determined through the up-votes (or lack
thereof) that it receives, the *quality* of the users who casted the up-votes is
arguably more important than the *quantity* of users who casted votes.
3. In order to properly calculate the quality of each user, a reputation system
is needed. A user's reputation should dictate the amount of influence that user
has within the network.
4. Reputation cannot be an abundant resource that is freely available within the
network. Increasing a user's reputation must come at a cost to that
user---either financial, or in the form of sweat equity[^fn16].
5. To prevent timing attacks[^fn17], reputation within the network should not be
easily transferred or sold.
6. Rewards are needed to encourage users to acquire (and compete for)
reputation and influence in the network via the creation and curation of
high-quality content. By the same token, penalties are needed to discourage
users of influence from abusing it.

## The High Quality Review

In a recent study conducted by [Bizrate Insights](https://bizrateinsights.com/),
66% of US internet users reference online reviews before making a purchase, even
if they are not purchasing that item online[^fn18]. With 1 billion consumers
slated to enter the cryptocurrency market over the next 9 years, the
high-quality cryptocurrency review will be the backbone of mainstream consumer
decision-making around cryptocurrencies.

# Cheddur 2.0

To align the interests of review writers, review readers, cryptocurrency
development teams, and the Cheddur team, Cheddur tokens (CHDR) will be
introduced in version 2.0 of the platform. The purpose of this token system
is to:

* Establish a reputation system to delegate user influence in the network.
* Determine the subjective quality of each user-generated review using the
wisdom of the crowd.
* Incentivize users to create and curate the highest-quality cryptocurrency
reviews via rewards and network influence.
* More accurately calculate the overall star rating (and popularity) of each
cryptocurrency project by favoring reviews that are deemed to be high quality.
* Minimize the effects of tribalism, astroturfing, review brigading, and other
forms of malicious activity.
* Empower the Cheddur community to be self-policing and self-sustaining.
* Enable newcomers to the cryptocurrency ecosystem to *earn* their way into the
market with little or no downside risk.

The targeted launch date for the Cheddur 2.0 platform is May 01, 2019.

## CHDR Tokens (\text{\sout{U}})

In order to achieve this, the CHDR currency will utilize the industry-leading
Proof of Brain[^fn19] properties that were pioneered by the
[Steem](https://steem.io/) blockchain and made available through the
[Smart Media Token](https://smt.steem.io/) (SMT) protocol. Each piece of
user-generated content will be stored on the Steem blockchain and voted on by
the Cheddur community in order to determine its social value, and therefore its
payout in \text{\sout{U}}.

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

### Why Steem?

By using the Steem blockchain, Cheddur users will be able to enjoy the benefits
of the blockchain without having to realize they are using one, thanks to
Steem's:

* Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism[^fn20].
* Zero transaction fees.
* Low latency provided by 3-second block times.
* High transactional throughput.
* [Stolen account recovery system](https://steemit.com/recover_account_step_1).

These features are paramount in order to serve the crypto novice customer
segment, and have made platforms like [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) a
non-starter for our use case.

### Rewards

\text{\sout{U}} tokens will be awarded via the programmatic inflation of the
CHDR supply. Inflation aligns the interests of each stakeholder as the *Cheddur
community as a whole*---reviewers, readers, developers, and the Cheddur
team---collectively pay for the creation and curation of high-quality content.

Review writers are able to post cryptocurrency reviews on the platform as
frequently as they'd like and at *zero cost*---much like the mainstream social
networks of today. This encourages the production of fresh cryptocurrency
reviews, which is healthy for the growth of the platform.

Review readers are able to cast votes on these reviews---also at no direct
cost---which encourages the curation of content. Reviews that are deemed by
the community to be of the highest quality (via up-votes) are rewarded in newly
minted \text{\sout{U}} tokens. In addition to the author receiving a reward for
their work, the curators who did the work of discovering and up-voting the
author's content are also rewarded for their efforts.

This creates a positive feedback loop between review writers and review readers
as they are financially incentivized to *work together* to deliver the
highest-quality content to the platform. Furthermore, each stakeholder in the
system is incentivized to maximize the growth of the network in order to offset
the downward effects of inflation on the price of their own \text{\sout{U}}. So
long as the rate of growth of the platform (e.g. high-quality reviews, profiles,
and users) exceeds the rate of inflation, each stakeholder will benefit in the
long run.

### Monetary Policy

The CHDR currency will start with an initial supply of 100MM \text{\sout{U}}.
To bootstrap early growth and participation in the Cheddur network, the CHDR
supply will inflate at an initial rate of 9.5% annually. Every year, the annual
inflation rate will decrease by 0.5% until an annual inflation rate of 1% is
reached. This will occur in the year 2036 and from then on, a 1% annual
inflation rate will be used into perpetuity.

### Token Inflation Events

Every 3 seconds, a token inflation event will occur on the Steem blockchain
that will introduce new \text{\sout{U}} tokens into circulation. The proceeds
from each token inflation event will be distributed as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]

  \centering

  \begin{tikzpicture}

   \pie[
    explode = 0.2,
    rotate = 210,
    text = pin
   ]{
     70/Rewards Pool,
     15/Vested \text{\sout{U}} Holders,
     10/Company Holdings,
     5/Bounty Programs
   }

  \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{Distribution of CHDR Inflation}

\end{figure}

### Rewards Pool

User-generated content that is posted on the Cheddur platform will be eligible
to earn \text{\sout{U}} tokens based upon the up-votes it receives from the
community. Payouts will be funded from the rewards pool and will occur exactly
7 days after each piece of content is posted. This one-week timeframe will
incentivize authors to promote their Cheddur content in a timely fashion across
other social networks. This distributed effort will bring traffic into the
Cheddur platform and help bootstrap the growth of the network.

Posting content on the Cheddur platform does not guarantee a payout in
\text{\sout{U}}. Reviews that receive zero up-votes will not be deemed to have
social value by the Steem blockchain and therefore will not receive a reward.
Furthermore, each review must compete for rewards against the other reviews
that are posted within a similar timeframe. Thus, it is possible that a review
which only receives a small number of up-votes---especially from users of
weak reputation---may not prove to have enough social value to earn a reward
in comparison to other content.

Payouts that are awarded to content of high social value will be divided between
the author and the curators as follows:

\begin{figure}[H]

  \centering

  \begin{tikzpicture}

   \pie[
    explode = 0.2,
    rotate = 210,
    text = pin
   ]{
     80/Author,
     20/Curators
   }

  \end{tikzpicture}

  \caption{Distribution of \text{\sout{U}} Rewards}

\end{figure}

#### Rewards Curves

As defined within the SMT protocol, the CHDR currency will use a $rc_linear$
rewards curve to distribute \text{\sout{U}} rewards among each piece of content,
and a $cc_sqrt$ curation curve to divide \text{\sout{U}} rewards among the
curators of an individual piece of content.

### "Powering Up"

To encourage users to invest in the long-term success of the Cheddur platform
(rather than panic selling 100% of their \text{\sout{U}} rewards),
\text{\sout{U}} tokens can be vested (or "staked") in a user's account in order
to increase their reputation in the network and to earn interest. This process
is referred to as "powering up" your \text{\sout{U}} tokens because it
increases your overall influence within the network.

15% of all \text{\sout{U}} tokens generated through inflation are earmarked for
vested token holders. The amount of \text{\sout{U}} tokens that each vested
token holder will receive is proportional to the amount of \text{\sout{U}}
tokens that are staked in their account.

### Influence

"One account, one vote" reputation systems can easily be undermined through
Sybil attacks, astroturfing, and vote brigading. Therefore, influence within the
Cheddur network will instead be determined under a *"one token, one vote"*
policy based on the amount of vested \text{\sout{U}} tokens each user has in
their account.

This will favorably skew influence over the network towards users who have
skin in the game---through earning or buying---and are vested in the long-term
uccess of the platform.

### "Powering Down"

While the process of powering up one's \text{\sout{U}} tokens happens
instantaneously, the inverse---or "powering down" one's \text{\sout{U}}
tokens---will occur over a 13-week period. This is a safeguard to prevent a
malicious user from powering up their tokens, using their increased influence to
adversely affect the system, and then immediately selling their \text{\sout{U}}
tokens on the open market before the price of CHDR has a chance to reflect any
potential damage.

Over the course of this 13-week period, vested \text{\sout{U}} tokens will
be converted back into normal \text{\sout{U}} tokens in weekly amounts of
\nicefrac{1}{13}. The process of powering down \text{\sout{U}} tokens can be
canceled at any time.

### Voting Power

To prevent users from spamming the network with up-votes, each user will be able
to cast a maximum of 50 up-votes per every 5 days, or ~10 up-votes per day.

You can think of a user's "voting power" as a mana bar that fills from 0% to
100%. Each up-vote that a user casts will expend 2% of his or her voting power.
This means that if a user starts at 100% voting power, they can cast, at a
maximum, 50 up-votes in a single day. Voting power will recharge at a rate of
20% per day, so a user who has 0% voting power today will be able to cast, at a
maximum, 10 votes tomorrow.

Seth Tomlinson concisely explains the mechanics of Steem's voting power
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLsPI65HzPI).

## Rating & Review Algorithms

By using the Steem blockchain to calculate the social value of each
cryptocurrency review, we can be more intelligent about how the overall star
rating of each cryptocurrency project is calculated. Rather than every review
carrying an equal weight towards the overall star rating of a project (as exists
today in Cheddur 1.0), we will implement new algorithms to skew the overall
rating towards reviews that are deemed by the community to be of high quality.

### Review Score

First, we will calculate a $Review Score$ for every review in order to determine
how much weight each should have on the target's overall rating. For a review of
$v$ number of up-votes and $u$ number of \text{\sout{U}} rewards, the review
score will be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  Vote Points = v * 2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Reward Points = u * 10
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Review Score = Vote Points + Reward Points
\end{equation}

**Note:** Reviews that accrue 0 votes ($v = 0$ and $u = 0$) will result in
$Review Score = 0$ and will not factor into the overall rating. Review scores
will be rounded to the nearest integer.

### Overall Rating

The review score for each cryptocurrency review will be used to determine how
much weight each individual rating should have on the project's
$Overall Rating$. The higher a review's score, the more impact its rating will
have on the overall---and vice versa. For $n$ number of reviews, the overall
rating will be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  Total Review Score = \sum_k^n(Review Score_k)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Overall Rating = \frac{\sum_k^n(Review Score_k * Review Rating_k)}{Total Review Score}
\end{equation}

### Popularity

When a user is browsing through coins and crypto apps on the Cheddur platform,
the results will be sorted based on $Popularity$ (highest to lowest) as the
default.

For $w$ number of "watchers" who have added Coin C to their Cheddur Watchlist
and $u$ number of users who have posted their public Coin C addresses on
Cheddur, the popularity of Coin C will be calculated as follows:

\begin{equation}
  User Score_c = u * 3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  Popularity_c = Total Review Score_c + User Score_c + w
\end{equation}

Being that users cannot add crypto apps to their Cheddur Watchlist or post coin
addresses to crypto app pages, the popularity of crypto App A will simply be
calculated as:

\begin{equation}
  Popularity_a = Total Review Score_a
\end{equation}

### Coin Example

\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | c | c |}

    \hline

    \multicolumn{5}{| c |}{\textbf{Coin C}} \\

    \hline

    \textbf{Reviewer} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Up-Votes} & \textbf{\text{\sout{U}} Payout} & \textbf{Review Score} \\

    \hline

    Alice & 5 & 2 & 1.45 & 19 \\

    \hline

    Bob & 1 & 1 & 0.5 & 7 \\

    \hline

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

Given that Coin C has 10 watchers and 4 users who have posted their public Coin
C addresses, $Total Review Score_c = 26$, $Overall Rating_c = 3.92$, and
$Popularity_c = 48$.

### App Example

\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabular}{| l | c | c | c | c |}

    \hline

    \multicolumn{5}{| c |}{\textbf{App A}} \\

    \hline

    \textbf{Reviewer} & \textbf{Rating} & \textbf{Up-Votes} & \textbf{\text{\sout{U}} Payout} & \textbf{Review Score} \\

    \hline

    Alice & 1 & 2 & 1.45 & 19 \\

    \hline

    Bob & 5 & 1 & 0.5 & 7 \\

    \hline

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

$Total Review Score_a = 26$, $Overall Rating_a = 2.08$, and
$Popularity_a = 26$.

### Algorithm Upgrades

Results from $Review Score$, $Overall Rating$, and $Popularity$ computations
will be stored outside of the consensus of the Steem blockchain on Cheddur's
own servers. This will allow the Cheddur team to upgrade these algorithms over
time to better reflect the wisdom of the crowd.

## CHDR Dimensions of Value

Once the Cheddur 2.0 platform goes live, users will only be able to acquire
\text{\sout{U}} tokens by:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]

  \item Earning them through the production of high-quality reviews.

  \item Earning them by completing bounties.

  \item Buying them on the open market.

  \item Powering them up within their user accounts in order to earn interest.

\end{enumerate}

In scenario (A), more high-quality reviews will be added to the Cheddur
platform which is likely to attract more users and growth. In scenario (B),
more users and engagement will be brought to the Cheddur platform which will
also spur growth. In scenarios (C) and (D), \text{\sout{U}} tokens will be
purchased on the open market and/or locked away, thereby reducing the
circulating supply of the CHDR currency. Each of these outcomes are favorable
for the Cheddur platform and will increase the value that gets accrued to the
token.

### Advertising

As competition over the rewards pool grows, user traffic will grow with it.
Upon claiming their free Cheddur profiles, coin and crypto app developers will
be able to pay for targeted advertising on the platform using a
[pay-per-click (PPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay-per-click) model. All
advertisements will be funded using \text{\sout{U}} tokens (either directly
or indirectly), and all \text{\sout{U}} tokens that are collected from in-app
advertising will be **burned** by the Cheddur team. This will further reduce the
circulating supply of the CHDR currency and will help offset inflation.

## Bounty Program

Users will be able to earn additional \text{\sout{U}} tokens by completing
valuable bounties. 15% of all \text{\sout{U}} tokens generated through inflation
are earmarked for bounties in order to accelerate the adoption of Cheddur.

Bounties will be run outside of the consensus of the Steem blockchain, which
will new bounties to be tested and existing bounties to be tweaked over time.

### First to Review Bounty

To encourage users to try out and review new (or lesser-known) cryptocurrency
projects, the first user to review each project will receive 3x the normal
payout of \text{\sout{U}} tokens.

### Profile Listing Bounty

To encourage cryptocurrency development teams to self-list their projects on the
Cheddur platform, \text{\sout{U}}50 will be awarded to the submitter of a
[new coin](https://www.cheddur.com/coin) or a
[new app](https://www.cheddur.com/app). This \text{\sout{U}}50 reward can be
applied by cryptocurrency development teams towards their first in-app
advertisement.

All submissions will be reviewed by Cheddur moderators for quality purposes.

### Profile Claiming Bounty

To encourage cryptocurrency development teams to claim their free Cheddur
profiles, \text{\sout{U}}50 will be awarded to the team member who successfully
claims a profile using our automated verification system or manual verification.
This \text{\sout{U}}50 reward can also be applied towards in-app advertising.

### Referral Program

When a new user signs up for Cheddur using an existing user's referral link,
both the new user and the referrer will earn \text{\sout{U}}25. This will
encourage users to bring their friends and followers to Cheddur.

# Initial Coin Offering

Capital has been raised from private investors in order to fund the development
of Cheddur 2.0. In order to distribute CHDR tokens to STEEM holders and to raise
capital for the ongoing development of the platform, we will be conducting an
ICO using the built-in capabilities of the SMT protocol.

\begin{table}[H]

  \begin{tabular}{| l | l |}

    \hline

    \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\

    \hline

    Start Date & April 01, 2019 \\

    \hline

    End Date & April 30, 2019 \\

    \hline

    Currencies Accepted & STEEM \\

    \hline

    Minimum Contribution & 1 STEEM \\

    \hline

    Hard Cap & 20MM USD \\

    \hline

  \end{tabular}

\end{table}

The targeted launch date for the Cheddur 2.0 platform is May 01, 2019---the day
after the ICO concludes.

## Token Distribution

The initial supply of 100MM \text{\sout{U}} tokens will be distributed as
follows:

\begin{center}

  \begin{tikzpicture}

   \pie[
     explode = 0.2,
     rotate = 90,
     text = pin
   ]{
     55/Token Sale,
     15/Company Holdings,
     15/Team and Advisors,
     10/Private Sales,
     5/Bounty Program
   }

  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

## Use of Funds

The 15MM \text{\sout{U}} tokens that will be in the company's possession will
be utilized as follows:

\begin{center}

  \begin{tikzpicture}

   \pie[
   explode = 0.2,
   rotate = 90,
   text = pin
   ]{
     50/Development,
     25/Sales and Marketing,
     10/Operations,
     10/Legal,
     5/Reserves
   }

  \end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}

# Competition

For any rewards-based √êApp, the most critical question to answer is: "Who pays
the bill?" In the case of Cheddur, the question is more specifically: *"Who pays
reviewers to produce high-quality reviews?"*

**Our competitors have gotten this wrong.**

In most √êApps today (i.e. applications that are built on top of Ethereum), the
person who initiates the transaction generally has to foot the bill. If these
mechanics were to be used on Cheddur, then a review writer would need to pay a
platform fee in order to post their cryptocurrency review and a review reader
would need to pay the writer their reward (directly) in the form of an up-vote.

In this scenario, interests are misaligned between each of the parties
involved. In order to boostrap the growth of the network, the Cheddur platform
will need cryptocurrency reviews more than review writers will need to post
them. If a transaction fee (or pay wall) is introduced in order for content to
be posted on the network, little or no content will be posted on the network at
all. Furthermore, if review readers are responsible for rewarding review writers
directly from their own wallets (another pay wall), users will need to maintain
a minimum balance on their account in order to interact with the platform.

More importantly, the incentive to curate content will be diminished altogether
because doing so comes at a cost to the user, rather than a benefit. In the
absence of curation, writers will not be appropriately rewarded and high-quality
content will become harder to find (and eventually cease to exist).

For these reasons, we've taken a different approach to rewarding users within
the Cheddur ecosystem. Rather than individual users having to pay rewards and
fees directly, \text{\sout{U}} tokens will be awarded via the programmatic
inflation of the CHDR supply. Inflation aligns the interests of each stakeholder
as the *Cheddur community as a whole*---reviewers, readers, developers, and the
Cheddur team---collectively pay for the creation and curation of high-quality
content.

# FAQ

0. Scam projects?
  * Not our decision. Our goal is to be factually complete. We focus on listing
  new and interesting cryptocurrency projects based on user demand and the
  *facts* that we find on the Internet. It is up to the Cheddur community to
  decide.
0. Sybil attack?
    * Even if restrictions are enacted at the account level to prevent a user
    from reviewing the same project more than once, these restrictions can generally
    be overcome through Sybil attacks.
1. How to prevent malicious voting?
    * Your votes have minimum weight by default
    * Voting power is based on the balance of vested coins in your account
        * More vested coins = more power, and visa versa
    * If you have high voting power (high stake) and you vote maliciously, you are hurting
    yourself because your coins are staked and you can't immediately sell them
    * This method of assigning power has been battle-tested on Steem
2. How will introducing the Cheddur currency grow the system?
    * Higher rate of inflation in the early days to incentivize early adoption
    * More users -> more competition -> review quality increases over time -> price goes up
        * More traffic -> more advertising -> more coins are burned -> price goes up
3. How to control inflation?
    * Burn advertising coins
4. How to prevent the price from dumping from users immediately selling rewards?
    * Selling will exist, but will incentivize users to vest portion of their earnings
        * Interest and voting power given to those who vest
5. bad profile submission.
  * still get bounty?
  * users listing projects prematurely to scoop the rewards?

# TODO

* market size: talk about VC investment, number of projects in 2020...
* Flush out scope of work:
    * Should profile submissions and edits be tokenized, too?
    * Can listings be tokenized later, or does this have to be set on day 1?
* Platform to build on?
    * Steem (SMT)
    * Steem (direct)
    * EOS
    * Ethereum
* ICO or Airdrop?
    * Use of funds
* Flush out all parameters of the monetary policy
    * Initial supply, distribution
    * Inflation curve
    * Rewards pool, distribution
    * Vesting / de-vesting
    * Platform fee vs. burning coins from the ad network:
        * No platform fee, but keep coins spent on advertising?
        * Platform fee, but burn all ad coins?
        * Platform fee, but burn ad coins up to a certain extent (e.g. BNB Coin)?
* Migration strategy
* Roadmap dates and features
* should bounty rewards be a fixed amount or fixed amount per day divided among, with max (Steemhunt)
